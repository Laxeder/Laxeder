### Hello World! I'm Laxederâ˜•

I am a back-end programmer

I started to program small Android apps in Java (conversation apps and a file manager app) 

I'm currently programming in JavaScript, but I prefer programming js with Node

I have a little experience in API building with Node and chatbot development.

I'm teaching chatbot development on my YouTube channel ([Link](https://duckduckgo.com/))
